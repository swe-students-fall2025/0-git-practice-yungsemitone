[Softwareâ€™s Death by AI Has Been Greatly Exaggerated](https://www.wsj.com/finance/softwares-death-by-ai-has-been-greatly-exaggerated-b639c0cd#)


## Why is this interesting?

I find this article very interesting because it's a very relevant topic that plagues the minds of every computer science major, as well as many other students.  We are all worried about AI taking our jobs by making the entry level positions obselete.  I find this article reassuring, not only because it was published on my 21st birthday which adds some extra fun, but because it gives me, and hopefully others, faith that a path still exists for most of us.  

Models like Chat-GPT are able to write code, though not very well, but executives still see the benefit of having humans to code, to ensure mistakes are fixed properly.  I think that will be our leg up over AI in the coming years; our ability to truly think on our feet will not be matched anytime soon (hopefully).
