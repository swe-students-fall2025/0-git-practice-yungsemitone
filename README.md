[Softwareâ€™s Death by AI Has Been Greatly Exaggerated](https://www.wsj.com/finance/softwares-death-by-ai-has-been-greatly-exaggerated-b639c0cd#)


## Why is this interesting?

I find this article very interesting because it's a very relevant topic that plagues the minds of every computer science major, as well as many other students.  We are all worried about AI taking our jobs by making the entry level positions obselete.  I find this article reassuring, not only because it was published on my 21st birthday which adds some extra fun, but because it gives me, and hopefully others, faith that a path still exists for most of us.  

Models like Chat-GPT are able to write code, though not very well, but executives still see the benefit of having humans to code, to ensure mistakes are fixed properly.  I think that will be our leg up over AI in the coming years; our ability to truly think on our feet will not be matched anytime soon (hopefully).

## Lunas Response
Happy belated birthday Aden. I agree, its definitely a topic that on every CS majors mind. The worry about AI replacing jobs is real, but I can argue that AI still is unable to replicate the critical thinking, creativity, and problem solving skills that humans have. Soft skills like communication and emotional intelligence are essential in a work enviroment and AI cant replicate that.  I think at the end of the day its about finding the balance between leveraging AI tools since AI can be useful in the sense that it can expedite repetitive processes.
